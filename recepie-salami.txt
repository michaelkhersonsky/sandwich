Directions In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, black pepper, garlic, mustard seed and curing salt until well blended. Divide into 2 or 4 rolls, wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 24 hours. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the wrapped rolls in the water, and simmer for 1 hour over medium to low heat.
